# Introduction to my dataset for project: "The Economic Value of College Majors"
- This dataset is based on the United States census information and contains information about US college majors and their future career economic outlook.

# Assignment 3 - Guide for interactions in graph:
Map interactions:
- A selected country will thicken the border size of the country making the country more visible
- If you hover over a country in the world map, then the corresponding circle in the scatterplot will pop out at the user
- For all of these interactions, after the mouse leaves, the country will go back to its original state

Scatterplot interactions:
- in-progress :D
