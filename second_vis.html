                    <b>Design Concept: </b> To show which are the majors that are making the most money in terms on their median salaries<br/><br/>
                    I wanted to show these in terms of their median salary because the majority of the people make money within this
                    category. <br/>
                    Thus, majors with the highest median salaries are placed near the top. While the majors who make the least money <br/>
                    in terms of their median salaries are at the bottom of the graph. In other words, these medium salaries were sorted from descending order.
