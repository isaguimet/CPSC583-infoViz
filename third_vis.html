                    The 3rd variation focuses on showing the total number of graduates for their respective Majors and other information such as<br/>
                    how many of these people are employed, unemployed and employed full time.<br/>
                    Note: There were some majors in the data that had a very high total number of graduates. So this graph majorly focuses
                    on the majors <br/> that have a
                    total less than 1 000 000. Those major that do reach more than or equal to 1 000 000 are simply capped
                    at that point.
