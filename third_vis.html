                <p class="third-viz-desc">
                    <b>Design Concept: </b> To show how popular majors (which have the highest total numbers) compare with the least popular majors 
                    in terms of number of people employed vs number of people unemployed.<br/>
                    The 3rd variation focuses on showing the total number of graduates for their respective majors and other information such as<br/>
                    how many of these people are employed, unemployed and employed full time.<br/>
                     <br/>
                    Note: There is 1 major (Business management and administration) which has a very high total number of graduates so in order
                    too keep the scale meaningful I decided to cap this major off at 2 400 000 graduates.
